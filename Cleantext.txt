If we look more deeply into humanity ancient religions and spiritual
traditions, we will find that underneath the many surface differences there
are two core insights that most of them agree on. The words they use to
describe those insights differ yet they all point to a twofold fundamental
truth. The first part of this truth is the realization that the “normal” state of
mind of most human beings contains a strong element of what we might call
dysfunction or even madness. Certain teachings at the heart of Hinduism
perhaps   come  closest  to  seeing  this   dysfunction  as   a  form  of collective
mental illness. They call it  maya  the veil of delusion Ramana Maharshi
one of the greatest Indian sages bluntly states The mind is maya
Buddhism uses different terms According to the Buddha the human
mind   in   its   normal   state   generates  dukkha   which   can   be   translated   as
suffering   unsatisfactoriness   or   just   plain   misery   He   sees   it   as   a
characteristic of the human condition Wherever you go, whatever you do
says the Buddha you will encounter  dukkha  and it will manifest in every
situation sooner or later
